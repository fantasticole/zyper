This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run, clone the repo and `yarn install` from inside of the `zyper` directory. Once that is done, run `yarn start`.

I was unable to get the response data coming through because I couldn't get the job id from the original `start` response. I tried looking at the response itself in addition to running `.text()` and `.json()` on it but still could not get it. I ended up copying the response from the sample page in order to have data to populate the page.

Thank you!
